# Autonomous-Car-Simulation
Designed and implemented a Python-based simulation where autonomous cars navigate a track without deviation or collision. Employed NEAT algorithm to train neural networks controlling cars.
Project Overview:
Created a simulation environment for virtual cars to autonomously navigate a predefined track. Focused on developing an adaptive control system for continuous improvement in navigation skills.

Key Features:
- Track Environment: Developed using Pygame 
- NEAT Algorithm: Trains neural networks to control cars, enabling adaptive decision-making.
- Autonomous Navigation: Cars make independent decisions using trained neural networks.
- Generational Improvement: Evaluation and iteration for continuous navigation enhancement.
- Scalability: Supports simultaneous spawning of multiple cars for efficient processing.
- Data Feedback: Utilises navigation data to refine subsequent generations, enhancing performance.

To run the program:
1. Clone the repository
2. Run the Pycar.py programme
